Docker uses iptables on the host to configure firewalls for host port mapping. With KVM/Proxmox, this can be troublesome when Docker suddenly starts putting firewall rules on your hypervisor. 

Add this forward rule for your proxmox bridge to allow it to get back into the network and not be dropped: `iptables -A FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -j ACCEPT`

Also install this package: `iptables-persistent`.
